## Application
* You'll see a **search box** with the label **Food**.
* The application will perform a search in the [Nutritionix](http://www.nutritionix.com/) database for the food you introduce.
* Once you click in any food element of the results list, it will be added to your list and its calories will increase the **total calories** of your food list.
* You can delete any food from your list by clicking it or the whole list by clicking in the `Clear list` option.
